		<h2>Why build a web résumé?</h2>
		<p>Your résumé tells your story to other people. Employers and recruiters are more likely to remember your résumé it tells an interesting story. Traditional résumés are non-interactive and dull. A personalized web résumé allows the person on the other end to explore and interact with your unique story. Hints and suggestions can flow throughout the résumé, to help the hiring side better understand you as a person. This more intimate interaction between your résumé and the other person, makes it more likely that hiring side will contact you for an interview.</p>
		<h2>How does your service work?</h2>
		<p>Send us your résumé as a Word or PDF document. We will work with you to build your web résumé, the way you want. And you get an opportunity to review your résumé, and make updates before the résumé goes live. We will host your résumé on our site, so that you have a convenient way of to show prospective employers your résumé. However, you can opt out of this free service if you choose.</p>
		<p>Your web résumé is a large, single page interactive HTML file, with many resources embedded inside. It should be viewable across most devices and browsers. The latest HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript technologies make this possible.</p>
		<h2>What features are included?</h2>
		<p>Our web résumés, include many features. All our résumés feature a built-in custom email-address and phone number encryptor/decryptor, to make it difficult for spammers to harvest your e-mail and phone number. We have also added printing support, so that your résumé looks as great on paper as on-screen. We will also help you with grammar and spelling. These are only some of the highlights of our service. There are many more features.</p>

		<p>We recommend that you try out basic, plus, and premium packages first. See if they meet your needs. If not, then you can consider custom. The cost of going custom is probably more and harder to estimate. Unlike our packages, we cannot leverage our prior work, testing, and build expertise to make it cheaper for you.</p>
		<h2>What does your minor update support cover?</h2>
		<p>We understand that you may want to make minor changes and tweak your résumé over the course of your job search process. This is why all our services come with a minor update support. This support package means that we will be obligated to support you in a timely manner and at no extra cost to you, if you wish to tweak your résumé. A tweak is a minor change that does not affect the overall look and feel and layout of your résumé. We will support you as many times as needed over the span of the coverage.</p>
		<p>If you wish to make minor changes, but your coverage has expired, please contact us. We will gladly help you update your résumé for you if we are not obligated elsewhere.</p>
		<p><b>Note!</b><i>If there is a problem with your résumé and you wish to have it fixed, it is your responsibility to contact us.</i></p>
